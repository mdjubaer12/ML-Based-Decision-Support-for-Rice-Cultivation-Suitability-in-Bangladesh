*Predicting Rice Production Suitability Using Weather Data*

## Overview

RiceYieldWeatherAdvisor is a machine learning research project aimed at forecasting whether upcoming weather conditions are favorable for rice production in Bangladesh. By generating a synthetic dataset based on historical optimum weather parameters for rice (temperature, rainfall, humidity, and sunshine duration), our supervised ML model predicts the suitability of the upcoming weather conditions for rice cultivation. If the predictions indicate unfavorable conditions, the system provides recommendations for necessary adaptations and interventions.
